# Project Week 35 GBM Series Tagging experiment

GBM series tagging experiment will be conducted within the Cloud & Open Data section at the [35th Project Week](https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW35_2021_Virtual).

There is a broad motivation to enrich the OPEN DATA offering in general and IDC data particularly. One of the approaches is to improve the richness of metadata accompanying images in IDC.

During project week we will be implementing a tool for tagging of individual series within an MRI exam with the series type. This tool is valuable for feeding data into subsequent analysis steps.

The experiment will be conducted on GBM dataset hosted in IDC. Catigorization of individual series was proposed in a recent article that's referenced in the project page.

One of the key fetures of the project is that it's cloud native. This means that all resources and data does not leave the cloud datacenter.
